- Racial equity is a **practice**, not a target
- Racial inequity is a **difference**, or disparity, in quality of service or access to resources
- Disparities can represent **injustice**
- Identifying the **mechanism** of injustice helps us:
  - Contemplate effective interventions
  - Identify other places affected by the same mechanism

As of 2024, California had 220 failing drinking water systems serving
nearly half a million people.

Lamont has received \$25 million in Water Board funding to help fix their failing
drinking water system, which included three wells exceeding the Maximum
Contaminant Level of arsenic and 1,2,3-tricholoropropane.

## Module 1: Identifying Injustice Recap

We found that people living in the **city center** are more likely to use public water,
and that in Lamont, those people are more likely to be **Hispanic** in origin.

We also know from the linked press release that mitigation efforts in Lamont included the destruction of **three 45-year-old wells**
that exceeded the state Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL) for **arsenic** and 
**1,2,3-trichloropropane**.

## What are the root causes of contamination and exposure to it?

Take **10 minutes** to discuss the root causes of contaminated water and exposure to it in Lamont. Some questions to consider include:

- How are people exposed to the contaminated water?
- How did contaminants get into the water?
- Why hadn't contaminants been removed from the water?

Use [this press release](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/press_room/press_releases/2023/pr021323-lamont.pdf) for extra context, if needed.

**One person from each group will share a summary of their group's discussion when we reconvene.**

## How are people exposed to the contaminated water?

::: incremental
- Public water use, which as we learned, is a function of where you live
- Why do people live where they live?
  - Redlining
  - Tribal lands
  - Proximity to work
:::

::: notes
An important factor, but not one within the Water Boards remit
:::

## How did contaminants get into the water?

::: incremental
- Age of wells
- Concentration of agricultural activity
:::

::: notes
- Public water wells typically have a lifespan of 20 to 50 years
- Chemical reactions of common pesticides may produce of 1,2,3-trichloropropane
:::

## Why hadn't contaminants been removed from the water?

::: incremental
- Permitting
- Cooperation
- Limited resources

# Scaling intervention

## Where else is the mechanism at play?

SAFER has funded **15 water system consolidation projects in Kern County**, where Lamont is located. That's about **16 percent** of SAFER-funded consolidations statewide. 

**Is there a common factor affecting water systems in Kern County that might also affect water systems in other counties?**

::: notes
Any of the root causes we just discussed.
:::

## Where else is the mechanism at play?

Let's focus on one of the mechanisms we suspect led to contamination: **agricultural activity.** If we can identify other places where agricultural activity occurs, then we might find other places where the water is contaminated.

**What data might help us understand the relationship between agriculture and water system health?**

## Mapping notes: Projections

- Maps are flat, the earth is not
- Projection determines how your mapping software translates the earth's curvature into a flat map
- Different projections won't overlay cleanly
  - A lot of software, like R, will throw an error if you ask it to operate on map layers in different projections

## Pesticide use

First, let's retrieve our data from CalEnviroscreen.

```{r ces_shp}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1-4|5-6"
#| results: false
unzip(paste(here(), "data/raw/calenviroscreen40shpf2021shp.zip", sep="/"), exdir = "data/raw/calenviroscreen40shpf2021shp") # <1>
ces_shp <- paste(here(), "data/raw/calenviroscreen40shpf2021shp/CES4 Final Shapefile.shp", sep="/")
ces <- read_sf(ces_shp) %>% st_transform(3310) # <2>
```

1. Extract data from ZIP archive
2. Read shapefile into R, using the Albers California projection

üîó [CalEnviroScreen - Download Data](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/download-data)
:::

## Pesticide use

Now, let's map pesticide use by tract.

```{r ces_map_a}
#| echo: true
#| results: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1-7|8-14"
#| output-location: slide
plotTheme <- list(
  theme_void(), 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")
  )
) # <1>

pesticide_use <- ggplot() + geom_sf( # <2>
  ces, color = "white", linewidth = 0.001, mapping = aes(fill = PesticideP)
) + scale_fill_distiller(
  palette = "Greens", direction = 1 # <3>
) + labs(
  title = "Agricultural Pesticide Use by Census Tract", subtitle = "Darker shade = higher percentile = more intensive pesticide use" # <4>
) + plotTheme
  
pesticide_use
```

1. Set some attractive default styles for our maps
2. Add tracts shaded by pesticide use percentile
3. Generate a legible color scale from ColorBrewer
4. Add a title and subtitle

## Pesticide use

Let's try a version of the map that only shows counties at or above the 75th
percentile to really emphasize heavy users.

```{r ces_map_b}
#| echo: true
#| results: false
#| code-line-numbers: "3|"
#| output-location: slide
top_pesticide_use <- ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(ces, color = "lightgray", mapping = aes()) + 
  geom_sf(
  ces %>% filter(PesticideP >= 75), color = "white", linewidth = 0.001, mapping = aes(fill = PesticideP) # <1>
) + scale_fill_distiller(
  palette = "Greens", direction = 1
) +
  labs(
    title = "Agricultural Pesticide Use by Census Tract - Top 25%", subtitle = "Darker shade = higher percentile = more intensive pesticide use"
  ) + plotTheme
  
top_pesticide_use
```

1. Filter data to only include tracts with pesticide use >= 75th percentile

## Pesticide use

::: columns

## Failing water systems

Now, let's take a look at SAFER data.

```{r safer_csv}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2-5"
safer_ra <- read_csv(paste(here(), "data/raw/SAFER_RA.csv", sep="/"))
safer_ra_as_sf <- st_as_sf(
  safer_ra %>% filter(LATITUDE_MEASURE != 0, LONGITUDE_MEASURE != 0), 
  coords=c("LONGITUDE_MEASURE", "LATITUDE_MEASURE"), crs=4326
) %>% st_transform(3310) # <1>
```
1. Create geospatial version of SAFER data in Albers California projection

:::

## Failing water systems

Plot the location of failing water systems on a map.

```{r safer_point_map}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2|3|"
#| results: false
#| output-location: slide
safer_point_map <- ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(ces, color = "lightgray", mapping = aes()) + # <1> 
  geom_sf(safer_ra_as_sf %>% filter(CURRENT_FAILING == 'Failing'), colour = "darkred", alpha = 0.5, mapping = aes()) + # <2>
  labs(title = "Failing Water Systems", subtitle = "Status determined by 2024 SAFER Risk Analysis") + 
  plotTheme
  
safer_point_map
```

1. Add a tract base map
2. Add a point layer showing failing water systems

## More pesticide use = more failing water systems?

Let's overlay failing systems with pesticide use to see if we can identify a
relationship.

```{r ces_safer_map}
#| echo: true
#| results: false
#| output-location: slide
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(ces, color = "lightgray", mapping = aes()) +
    geom_sf(
  ces %>% filter(PesticideP >= 75), color = "white", linewidth = 0.001, mapping = aes(fill = PesticideP)
) + scale_fill_distiller(
  palette = "Greens", direction = 1
) +
    geom_sf(safer_ra_as_sf %>% filter(CURRENT_FAILING == 'Failing'), colour = "darkred", alpha = 0.5, mapping = aes()) + 
    labs(title = "Pesticide Use and Failing Water Systems") +
    plotTheme 
```

## More pesticide use = more failing water systems?

Yikes! Let's make a version that's color blind friendly.

```{r ces_safer_map_b}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4,6|"
#| results: false
#| output-location: slide
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(ces, color = "lightgray", mapping = aes()) +
    geom_sf(
  ces %>% filter(PesticideP >= 75), color = "white", linewidth = 0.001, mapping = aes(fill = PesticideP)
) + scale_fill_distiller(
  palette = "Blues", direction = 1
) +
    geom_sf(safer_ra_as_sf %>% filter(CURRENT_FAILING == 'Failing'), colour = "darkorange", alpha = 0.5, mapping = aes()) + 
    labs(title = "Pesticide Use and Failing Water Systems") +
    plotTheme 
```

## More pesticide use = more failing water systems?

We can see a relationship, but how strong is it? Let's do a quick statistical
analysis to see whether there's a significant relationship between pesticide
use and failing water systems.

First, we need to aggregate the SAFER data by tract.

```{r tract_summary}
#| code-line-numbers: "1|3-7|9"
#| echo: TRUE
systems_with_tracts <- st_join(safer_ra_as_sf, ces) # <1>
  
failing_systems_by_tract <- systems_with_tracts %>% 
  group_by(Tract) %>% 
  summarize(n_systems = n(), n_failing = sum(CURRENT_FAILING == 'Failing', na.rm = TRUE), pct_failing = n_failing / n_systems * 100) # <2>
  
tracts_with_failing_systems <- st_join(ces, failing_systems_by_tract) # <3>
```

1. Perform geospatial join of water systems and tracts with CES data
2. Summarize number of systems, number of failing systems, and proportion systems
failing by tract.
3. Join summary data to tracts with CES, so that we can use both CES data and
summary values for analysis.

## More pesticide use = more failing water systems?

Next, we'll perform the analysis.

```{r analysis_correlation}
clean_data <- tracts_with_failing_systems %>% 
  filter(!is.na(PesticideP) & !is.na(pct_failing))
  
correlation <- cor(clean_data$PesticideP, clean_data$pct_failing)
if (abs(correlation) >= 0.7) {
  strength <- "strong"
} else if (abs(correlation) >= 0.4) {
  strength <- "moderate"
} else if (abs(correlation) >= 0.2) {
  strength <- "weak"
} else {
  strength <- "very weak/negligible"
}
direction <- ifelse(correlation > 0, "positive", "negative")
```

```{r analysis_linear_regression}
model <- lm(pct_failing ~ PesticideP, data = clean_data)
r_squared <- summary(model)$r.squared
p_value <- summary(model)$coefficients[2, 4]

if (p_value < 0.001) {
  pSignificance <- "highly significant ***"
} else if (p_value < 0.01) {
  pSignificance <- "very significant **"
} else if (p_value < 0.05) {
  pSignificance <- "significant *"
} else {
  pSignificance <- "not statistically significant"
}
```

```{r analysis_scatter_plot}
scatter_plot <- ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = PesticideP, y = pct_failing)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkorange", linetype = "dashed") +

::: notes
"The p-value tells you the probability that you'd see this strong of a relationship (or stronger) if there was actually no real connection between pesticide use and water system failures - so your tiny p-value means it's extremely unlikely this is just a coincidence."

Areas with higher pesticide use tend to have slightly more failing water systems, and while this relationship is statistically significant, it's pretty weak. Pesticide use explains only about 5% of the variation in water system failures (R-squared), suggesting that other factors like infrastructure age, funding, and geography play much larger roles.

Augment SAFER investments or fill the gaps?
:::

## Filling the gaps

Let's target water systems in tracts with high pesticide use that have not
received SAFER funding.

```{r unfunded_tracts}
#| code-line-numbers: "2|3|4|"
#| echo: true
unfunded_failing_systems <- systems_with_tracts %>% 
  filter(CURRENT_FAILING == 'Failing', FUNDING_RECEIVED_SINCE_2017 == 0, PesticideP >= 50) %>% # <1>
  select(WATER_SYSTEM_NUMBER, PL_ADDRESS_CITY_NAME, COUNTY, POPULATION, SERVICE_CONNECTIONS, FUNDING_RECEIVED_SINCE_2017, SERVICE_AREA_ECONOMIC_STATUS, PesticideP) %>% # <2>
  arrange(desc(POPULATION)) # <3>
```

1. Apply filters
2. Retrieve subset of columns
3. Sort by highest population first

## Filling the gaps

`r kable(head(unfunded_failing_systems, n = 5))`

## Filling the gaps

Finally, let's create a bubble map of those failing water systems, where the
point is scaled to the population served.

```{r bubble_map, evaluate = FALSE}
#| code-line-numbers: "1|3|4-10|5|9|16,21|17,22|"
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

  geom_point(
    unfunded_failing_systems %>% inner_join(safer_ra, by = "WATER_SYSTEM_NUMBER") %>% filter(LATITUDE_MEASURE != 0) %>% arrange(POPULATION.x), # <3>
    alpha = 0.75,
    shape = 21,
    stroke = 0,
    mapping = aes(size = POPULATION.x, fill = POPULATION.x, x = LONGITUDE_MEASURE, y = LATITUDE_MEASURE), # <4>
  ) + # <5>
  scale_fill_fermenter(
    type = "seq", 
    palette = "YlGnBu", 
    breaks = BREAKS, # <6>
    direction = 1,
    name = "Population",
    guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, stroke = 0.5, color = "black")) # <7>
  ) +
  scale_size_binned(
    breaks = BREAKS, # <6>
    name = "Population",
    guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, stroke = 0.5, color = "black")) # <7>
  ) + 
    labs(title = "Unfunded Failing Water Systems\nin Tracts with High Pesticide Use", subtitle = "Systems scaled and colored by population served") +
    plotTheme
```

1. Define custom breaks to better show variation
2. Re-project the tract base map to 4326, since we will be mapping lat/lon
3. Join failing system data to original SAFER data to retrieve lat/lon
4. Scale and color points by population
5. Use `geom_point()` instead of `geom_sf()`, because the latter doesn't behave
correctly with the size aesthetic.
6. Pass custom breaks into our color and scale functions
7. Specify that color/size should be shown on the same legend

## Putting it all together

::: incremental
- You might find a dozen places that ‚Äúlook‚Äù the same as Lamont
- Prioritize places where you see disparity
- Validate your hypothesis that the same mechanism is at work by engaging with
the community, peers, etc.
:::

## Where do we go from here?

Is our analysis complete? What are we missing? What assumptions are we making?
What would you do next?

## Where do we go from here?

::: incremental
- There are lots of wrong ways, but also lots of right ways
- Prioritize community engagement and partnerships
  - Validate and/or sharpen findings from data analysis
  - Address mechanisms outside your remit
  - Get at the full root cause, not just the water-shaped parts of it
