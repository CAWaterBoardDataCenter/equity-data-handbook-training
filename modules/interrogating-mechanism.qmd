## Module 1: Identifying Injustice Recap

::: incremental
- Racial equity is a **practice**, not a target
- Racial inequity is a **difference**, or disparity, in quality of service or access to resources
- Disparities can represent **injustice**
- Identifying the **mechanism** of injustice helps us:
  - Contemplate effective interventions
  - Identify other places affected by the same mechanism

## Module 1: Identifying Injustice Recap

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
As of 2024, California had 220 failing drinking water systems serving
nearly half a million people.

Lamont has received \$25 million in Water Board funding to help fix their failing
drinking water system, which included three wells exceeding the Maximum
Contaminant Level of arsenic and 1,2,3-tricholoropropane.

## Module 1: Identifying Injustice Recap

We found that people living in the **city center** are more likely to use public water,
and that in Lamont, those people are more likely to be **Hispanic** in origin.

We also know from the linked press release that mitigation efforts in Lamont included the destruction of **three 45-year-old wells**
that exceeded the state Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL) for **arsenic** and 
**1,2,3-trichloropropane**.

Analysis - Process](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/eval.html#process)
:::

## What are the root causes of contamination and exposure to it?

Take **10 minutes** to discuss the root causes of contaminated water and exposure to it. Some questions to consider include:

- How are people exposed to the contaminated water?
- How did contaminants get into the water?
- What hadn't contaminants been removed from the water?

Use [this press release](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/press_room/press_releases/2023/pr021323-lamont.pdf) for extra context, if needed.

**One person from each group will share a summary of their group's discussion when we reconvene.**

## How are people exposed to the contaminated water?

::: incremental
- Public water use, which as we learned, is a function of where you live
- Why do people live where they live?
  - Redlining
  - Tribal lands
  - Proximity to work
:::

::: notes
An important factor, but not one within the Water Boards remit
:::

## How did contaminants get into the water?

::: incremental
- Age of wells
- Concentration of agricultural activity
:::

::: notes
- Public water wells typically have a lifespan of 20 to 50 years
- Chemical reactions of common pesticides may produce of 1,2,3-trichloropropane
:::

## Why hadn't contaminants been removed from the water?

::: incremental
- Permitting
- Cooperation
- Limited resources
::: 

::: notes
Resources = SAFER lever!
:::
  
# Scaling intervention

## Where else is the mechanism at play?

SAFER has funded **15** water system consolidation projects in Kern County, where Lamont is located. That's about **16 percent** of SAFER-funded consolidations statewide. 

**Is there a common factor affecting water systems in Kern County that might also affect water systems in other counties?**

Let's focus on one of the mechanisms we suspect led to contamination: **agricultural activity.** If we can identify other places where agricultural activity occurs, then we might find other places where the water is contaminated.

## What data might help us understand the relationship between agriculture and water system health?

::: notes
- Land use
- Pesticide use
- Water system status (SAFER)

## Pesticide use

1. Retrieve CalEnviroScreen data

Why CES? 

- Pesticide use is a proven vector of contamination
- CalEnviroScreen does a lot of processing for us ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Pesticide use

2. Map pesticide use

```{r ces_map}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4-6|8-10"
#| results: false
#| output-location: slide
plotTheme <- list(
  theme_void(), 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"), legend.position = "top", legend.direction = "horizontal"
  )
)

pesticide_use <- list(geom_sf(
  ces, color = "white", linewidth = 0.001, mapping = aes(fill = PesticideP)
), scale_fill_distiller(
  palette = "Greens", direction = 1
))

ggplot() + pesticide_use + labs(
  title = "Agricultural Pesticide Use by Census Tract", subtitle = "Darker shade = higher percentile = more intensive pesticide use"
) + plotTheme
```

## Failing water systems

3. Retrieve SAFER data

#| results: false

```

## Failing water systems

4. Map failing water systems

```{r safer_map}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1-5|7-9"
#| results: false
#| output-location: slide
failing_water_systems <- geom_point(
    safer_ra %>% 
      filter(LATITUDE_MEASURE != 0) %>% 
      filter(CURRENT_FAILING == "Failing"), 
    shape = 21, colour = "white", fill = "#9E1B07", size=3, stroke=0.5,
    mapping = aes(x = LONGITUDE_MEASURE, y = LATITUDE_MEASURE)
  )

ggplot() + borders("state", region = "california") + failing_water_systems + coord_quickmap() + labs(
  title = "Failing Water Systems", subtitle = "Status determined by 2024 SAFER Risk Analysis"
) + plotTheme
```

## Putting it all together

5. Overlay pesticide use with failing water systems

```{r ces_safer_map}
#| echo: true
#| results: false
#| output-location: slide
ggplot() +
    pesticide_use +
    failing_water_systems + 
    plotTheme + labs(title = "Pesticide Use and Failing Water Systems")
```

## Putting it all together

- Aggregate water system status to tract and compare intensity of pesticide use with prevalence of failing water systems

## What should we do?

- What do we have the authority to do? What cause/s can we address?
- What interventions are already in place?
- Determine relationship to existing interventions

::: notes
Augment SAFER investments or fill the gaps?
:::

## Filling the gaps

Aggregate SAFER funding by tract.

```{r safer_funding_by_tract}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: 1-2|3-5|6|7-10
ca_tracts <- tigris::tracts(state = "CA", year=2024) %>% st_transform(4326)
safer_ra_sf <- st_as_sf(safer_ra %>% filter(LONGITUDE_MEASURE != 0), coords=c("LONGITUDE_MEASURE", "LATITUDE_MEASURE"), crs=4326)
safer_tracts <- st_join(ca_tracts, safer_ra_sf)
safer_funding_by_tract <- safer_tracts %>% group_by(GEOID) %>% 
replace_na(list(FUNDING_RECEIVED_SINCE_2017=0)) %>% summarise(funding_received=sum(FUNDING_RECEIVED_SINCE_2017) / 1000000)
```

## Filling the gaps

Highlight tracts receiving SAFER funding.

```{r combined_map}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: 1-3|5-6
#| output-location: slide
funding_received <- geom_sf(data = safer_funding_by_tract %>% filter(funding_received > 0), linewidth = 0.5, alpha = 0, color = "black")

ggplot() +
    pesticide_use +
    funding_received +
    failing_water_systems + 
    plotTheme + labs(title = "Pesticide Use and Failing Water Systems", subtitle = "Tracts with one or more water system receiving funding from SAFER outlined in black")
```

::: notes
- Maybe you're not in SAFER... but you can use that to understand where support exists...
- Maybe you are in SAFER, evaluate use of resources
:::

## Filling the gaps

Identify water systems receiving little/no SAFER funding in tracts with high pesticide use.

```{r, evaluate = FALSE}
ces_plus_safer_ra <- st_join(ces, safer_funding_by_tract)
```

## Putting it all together

Once you've identified your candidate water systems, repeat the original analysis with your reproducible code!

::: incremental
- May find a dozen places that ‚Äúlook‚Äù the same as Lamont
- Prioritize places where you see disparity
- Interrogate the problem and intervene where the same mechanism is at play
:::

## Where do we go from here?

::: incremental
- There are lots of wrong ways, but no one right way
- Opportunities for community engagement and partnerships
  - Validate and/or sharpen findings from data analysis
  - Address mechanisms outside your remit
