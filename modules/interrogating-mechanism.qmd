As of 2024, California had 220 failing drinking water systems serving
nearly half a million people.

One of them, Lamont, has received \$25 million in Water Board funding to
help fix their water system, which included three wells exceeding the Maximum
Contaminant Level of arsenic and 1,2,3-tricholoropropane.

In Kern County, where Lamont is located, 14 other projects consolidating more than 50
systems, including two schools, are currently being developed through SAFER. Since it
was launched in July 2019, the program has invested over $65 million in the county for
a variety of drinking water projects that will ultimately benefit 212,000 people. Statewide,
95 consolidations have been completed, providing 78,000 people with safe drinking
water.
