## What is racial equity?

The Water Boards defines racial equity as a series of conditions:

::: fragment
-   Race no longer predicts a personâ€™s access to water or the quality of
    water resources they receive
:::

::: fragment
-   Race does not predict professional outcomes for our employees
:::

::: fragment
::: {.fragment .highlight-blue}
-   We consistently consider racial equity impacts before we make
    decisions

:::

::: notes
-   Let's define what we're talking about so we're on the same page as
    we start working together
-   Walk through water boards definition of racial equity
-   Racial equity is a **practice** that adds up to results
    -   Ground work in equity practice
    -   Refine equity practice based on results
:::

## What does inequity look like?

::: incremental
-   The Water Boards defines equity as "a future where race no longer
    predicts a personâ€™s access to water or the quality of water
    resources they receive"
-   It follows that inequity looks like a difference or disparity in
    access or resources

policy, or process, and populations affected by
it](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/plan-prep/plan.html)
:::

::: notes
-   Baseline: Access to resources and/or exposure to harm is equally
    distributed
-   Adjust according to your needs
:::

## Why are we interested in disparity?

::: incremental
-   A difference in exposure to harm or access to resources could
    represent **injustice**.
-   Disparate outcomes can hint at the **cause or mechanism of
    injustice**.
:::

## Why are we interested in mechanisms?

Considering the **mechanism of injustice** allows us to:

::: incremental
  -   Contemplate effective interventions.
  -   Identify other places affected by the same cause or mechanism.
:::

## Root cause analysis

> "Technique that helps identify the fundamental reasons, or root causes, of a problem or unwanted outcome"

- Allocate time
- Honor hard truths

# Exercise: Failing water system in Lamont

## Background

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
As of 2024, California had 220 failing drinking water systems serving
nearly half a million people.

One of them, Lamont, received \$25 million in Water Board funding to
help fix their water system, which included three wells exceeding the Maximum
Contaminant Level of arsenic and 1,2,3-tricholoropropane.

:::

## Interrogating the failing water system in Lamont

::: incremental
-   Why is the water contaminated?
-   Who was exposed to water from this system? How?
-   Are there racial disparities in exposure? Why?
:::

## Reproducible data analysis

Why work in R (or another scriping language or software, such as Excel)?

::: incremental
  - Automate and reproduce your analysis
  - Public data resources are being removed, e.g., the EPA's Environmental Justice Screen. Lower level resources, like APIs, are less visible and therefore lower priority for censoring
:::
  
::: notes
- Approaches will be common across programming languages and software
- Details will be presented in R

:::

## Who was exposed to contaminated water?

**1. Retrieve Census data**

```{r race_ethnicity_by_block, cache=TRUE}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1-7|9-14|16-19"

STATE <- "CA"
COUNTY <- "Kern"
CITY <- "Lamont"

racevars <- c(
  White = "P2_005N",
  Black = "P2_006N",
  AmericanIndian = "P2_007N",
  Asian = "P2_008N",
  HawaiianPacificIslander = "P2_009N",
  Other = "P2_010N",
  TwoOrMoreRaces = "P2_011N",
  Hispanic = "P2_002N"
)

county_blocks <- get_decennial(year = 2020,
                               sumfile = "pl",
                               variables = racevars,

                               county = COUNTY,
                               geometry = TRUE,
                               summary_var = "P2_001N" ) %>%
  mutate(percent = 100 * (value / summary_value)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable,
              values_from = c(value, percent))

city_boundary <- tigris::places(state = STATE, cb = TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::filter(NAME == CITY)

city_blocks <- st_filter(county_blocks, city_boundary)
```

## Who was exposed to contaminated water?

**2. Generate dot density map layer**

```{r race_dots}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1-2|3-5"
race_dots <- dots::dots_points(shp = city_blocks,
                               cols = c(value_Hispanic,
                                        value_White,
                                        value_Black),
                               divisor = 10)  %>% 
  mutate(dots_type = case_when(dots_type == "value_Hispanic" ~ "Hispanic",
                               dots_type == "value_White" ~ "White",
                               dots_type == "value_Black" ~ "Black"))
```

::: footer
ðŸ”— [`dots` documentation](https://christophertkenny.com/dots/)
:::

## Who was exposed to contaminated water?

**3. Create dot density map**

```{r dot_density, fig.cap="Dot density plot of racial and ethnic distribution. One dot = 10 people"}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: ""
#| output-location: slide
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = city_blocks,
          fill = "grey", color = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = race_dots, size = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~ dots_type) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

## Assumptions

What are some of the assumptions that weâ€™ve made in this analysis, either
explicitly or implicitly that could pose a problem?

::: incremental
-   2020 Census Data accurately reflects the population in 2024
-   Everyone is equally capable of choosing/changing where they live
-   The demographic groups we selected are representative of the
    entire population
-   Public water use is evenly distributed

**What about private wells?**

In 2024, the US EPA attempted to predict the probability that residents
within a census block were using water from a public utility or private
well. Their model used data from the 1990 Decennial Census,
administrative data on well permitting, and other measures.
