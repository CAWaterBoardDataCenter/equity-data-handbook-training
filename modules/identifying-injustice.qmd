## What is racial equity?

The Water Boards defines racial equity as a series of conditions:

::: fragment
-   Race no longer predicts a person‚Äôs access to water or the quality of
    water resources they receive
:::

::: fragment
-   Race does not predict professional outcomes for our employees
:::

::: fragment
::: {.fragment .highlight-blue}
-   We consistently consider racial equity impacts before we make
    decisions

::: notes
-   Let's define what we're talking about so we're on the same page as
    we start working together
-   Walk through water boards definition of racial equity
-   Racial equity is a **practice** that adds up to results
    -   Ground work in equity practice
    -   Refine equity practice based on results
:::

## What does inequity look like?

::: incremental
-   The Water Boards defines equity as "a future where race no longer
    predicts a person‚Äôs access to water or the quality of water
    resources they receive"
-   It follows that inequity looks like **a difference or disparity in
    access or resources**

:::

::: notes
-   Baseline: Access to resources and/or exposure to harm is equally
    distributed
-   Adjust according to your needs
:::

## Why are we interested in disparity?

::: incremental
-   A difference in exposure to harm or access to resources could
    represent **injustice**.
-   Disparate outcomes can hint at the **cause or mechanism of
    injustice**.
:::

## Why are we interested in mechanisms?

Considering the **mechanism of injustice** allows us to:

::: incremental
  -   Contemplate effective interventions.
  -   Identify other places affected by the same cause or mechanism.

# Exercise: Failing water system in Lamont

## Background

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
As of 2024, California had 220 failing drinking water systems serving
nearly half a million people.

One of them, Lamont, received \$25 million in Water Board funding to
help fix their water system, which included three wells exceeding the Maximum
Contaminant Level of arsenic and 1,2,3-tricholoropropane.

:::

## Interrogating the failing water system in Lamont

::: incremental
-   Why is the water contaminated?
-   Who was exposed to water from this system? How?
-   Are there racial disparities in exposure? Why?
- **Other questions?**
:::

## Reproducible data analysis

Why work in R (or another scriping language or software, such as Excel)?

::: incremental
  - Automate and reproduce your analysis
  - Public data resources are being removed, e.g., the EPA's Environmental Justice Screen. Lower level resources, like APIs, are less visible and therefore lower priority for censoring
:::
  
::: notes
Approaches will be common across programming languages and software
Details will be presented in R
:::

## Who was exposed?

Let's use Census data to determine who lives in Lamont, i.e., who was exposed to contaminated
water. We'll use the `tidycensus` R package to retrieve 2020 Census race/ethnicity data by Census block.

1. Store your API key with `tidycensus`.
2. Use the `get_decennial()` method from `tidycensus` to retrieve 2020 data
for our specified state and county at the block level.
3. Specify which variables to retrieve, and define a summary variable. Usually,
you'll use the total, or **universe**, variable as your summary variable so you
can, e.g., calculate proportions.
4. Tell `tidycensus` to return results with geospatial information, for mapping.
5. Add a new column to your results that calculates the proportion of the
population each group accounts for.

# Challenging assumptions

## Assumption 1: 2020 Census Data accurately reflects the population in 2024

Why decennial Census block data?

::: incremental
- **Blocks** are the smallest geographic unit but they are only available from 
decennial Census, not ACS estimates
- One reason for this is margin of error, which tends to be higher among smaller 
populations
- The ACS gives us access to **block groups**, but as the population of Lamont is 
small, the population of block groups may be small, so estimates may still have
high margins of error
:::

## Assumption 1: 2020 Census Data accurately reflects the population in 2024

Why decennial Census block data?

::: incremental
- Census data is a count, while ACS data is an estimate
  - Some groups are more likely to be underrepresented in a count, but estimates
  can have large margin of error
:::

In 2024, the US EPA attempted to predict the probability that residents
within a census block were using water from a public utility or private
well.

## Assumption 3: Everyone uses public water

Let's use EPA's estimates of probability of public water use to see where
Lamont residents are most likely to use public water.

Now, let's make a choropleth map of likelihood of public water use. Choropleth
maps shade geographies by a particular value, making it easy to see how that 
value varies across space.

![Example of a choropleth map](assets/choropleth_map.webp)

## Assumption 3: Everyone uses public water

```{r census_blocks_with_water_sources_map, cache=TRUE}
#| echo: true

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(city_blocks_with_water_sources, # <1>
          mapping = aes(geometry = geometry, # <2>

  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

1. Add geographic layer (map).
2. Define an **aesthetic**, or how fill (or other map attributes) should vary based on a particular value.

## Assumption 4: The population of Lamont is evenly distributed

We know that the probability of public water use, i.e., exposure to contaminants,
varies by where someone lives. What are the population dynamics in Lamont? Are
residents of all races & ethnicities evenly distributed?

Let's make some dot density maps to find out!

## Assumption 4: The population of Lamont is evenly distributed

A dot density map places dots representing one (or more) people or instances of
a phenomenon randomly within the geography where they live or occur. It approximately
illustrates the distribution of people or events in space.

![Example of dot density map](assets/dot_density_map.png)

N.b., Dots are randomly placed, i.e., the location of a dot does not indicate the
location of a person or event.

## Assumption 4: The population of Lamont is evenly distributed

Let's use the `dots` R package to generate random dot data for our maps.

```{r race_dots}
#| echo: true
race_dots <- dots::dots_points(shp = city_blocks,
                               cols = c(value_Hispanic,
                                        value_White,
                                        value_Asian,
                                        value_TwoOrMoreRaces),
                               divisor = 10)  %>%  # <1>
  mutate(dots_type = case_when(dots_type == "value_Hispanic" ~ "Hispanic",
                               dots_type == "value_White" ~ "White",
                               dots_type == "value_Asian" ~ "Asian",
                               dots_type == "value_TwoOrMoreRaces" ~ "Two or More Races")) # <2>
```

1. Create dot layer, where divisor defines how many people one dot represents.
2. Add a new column that creates a friendly label for each group.

        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

1. Use the Census blocks as a neutral base layer.
2. Add dots, colored by the group they represent.
3. Generate another color palette optimized for mapping.

::: notes
Encoding population type in a color is one way to show this data, but it's
pretty tough to read.

## Assumption 4: The population of Lamont is evenly distributed {auto-animate=true}

Let's use small multiples to make our map more legible.

```{r dot_density_map_facets}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = city_blocks,
          fill = "grey", color = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = race_dots, size = 0.5) + # <1>
  facet_wrap(~ dots_type) + # <2>
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

1. Remove the aesthetic we used to color our dots.
2. Use `facet_wrap()` to tell `ggplot2` to make a new plot for each group.

# Putting it all together

## Putting it all together

We know that both the probability of public water use and the race/ethnicity
of residents varies by Census block. We can overlay our water use map with our
dot density maps to illustrate that point.

```{r dot_density_water_probability}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: ""
#| output-location: slide
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(city_blocks_with_water_sources,
          mapping = aes(geometry = geometry,
                        fill = Prob_Pub),
                        color = NA) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "OrRd", direction = 1, labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(title = "Race/Ethnicity and Public Water Use - Lamont, Calif.", subtitle="One dot = 10 people", fill = "Probability of Public Water") +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_sf(race_dots, size=0.1, mapping = aes(geometry = geometry)) +
  facet_wrap(~dots_type)
```

## Putting it all together

To put a finer point on it, we can estimate the proportion of each group likely
using public water by calculating average probability of public water use
weighted by the size of each group.

```{r weighted_averages}
#| echo: true
demo_summary <- city_blocks_with_water_sources %>%
  summarize(
    prop_white = weighted.mean(Prob_Pub, w = value_White, na.rm = TRUE), # <1>
    prop_asian = weighted.mean(Prob_Pub, w = value_Asian, na.rm = TRUE),
    prop_hispanic = weighted.mean(Prob_Pub, w = value_Hispanic, na.rm = TRUE),
    prop_tom = weighted.mean(Prob_Pub, w = value_TwoOrMoreRaces, na.rm = TRUE),
    pp_white = sum(Prob_Pub * value_White, na.rm = TRUE),
    pp_asian = sum(Prob_Pub * value_Asian, na.rm = TRUE),
    pp_hispanic = sum(Prob_Pub * value_Hispanic, na.rm = TRUE),
    pp_tom = sum(Prob_Pub * value_TwoOrMoreRaces, na.rm = TRUE),
    white = sum(value_White, na.rm = TRUE),
    asian = sum(value_Asian, na.rm = TRUE),
    hispanic = sum(value_Hispanic, na.rm = TRUE),
    tom = sum(value_TwoOrMoreRaces, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

1. Use the `weighted.mean()` method from the `stats` package to calculate
weighted average.

::: notes
This is useful when you want to understand how different groups experience or 
are exposed to some condition, taking into account they live and how many of
them there are.

## What's next?

Take **10 minutes** to discuss next steps you might take, given our findings.
Some examples include:

- Talking to people in Lamont
- Identifying and answering additional questions
- Researching existing programs and resources

Use [this planning guidance from the handbook](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/plan-prep/plan.html) for extra context, if needed.

**One person from each group will share a summary of their group's discussion when we reconvene.**
