## What is racial equity?

The Water Boards defines racial equity as a series of conditions:

::: fragment
-   Race no longer predicts a personâ€™s access to water or the quality of
    water resources they receive
:::

::: fragment
-   Race does not predict professional outcomes for our employees
:::

::: fragment
::: {.fragment .highlight-blue}
-   We consistently consider racial equity impacts before we make
    decisions

:::

::: notes
-   Let's define what we're talking about so we're on the same page as
    we start working together
-   Walk through water boards definition of racial equity
-   Racial equity is a **practice** that adds up to results
    -   Ground work in equity practice
    -   Refine equity practice based on results
:::

## What does inequity look like?

::: incremental
-   The Water Boards defines equity as "a future where race no longer
    predicts a personâ€™s access to water or the quality of water
    resources they receive"
-   It follows that inequity looks like a difference or disparity in
    access or resources

:::

::: notes
-   Baseline: Access to resources and/or exposure to harm is equally
    distributed
-   Adjust according to your needs
:::

## Why are we interested in disparity?

::: incremental
-   A difference in exposure to harm or access to resources could
    represent **injustice**.
-   Disparate outcomes can hint at the **cause or mechanism of
    injustice**.
:::

## Why are we interested in mechanisms?

Considering the **mechanism of injustice** allows us to:

::: incremental
  -   Contemplate effective interventions.
  -   Identify other places affected by the same cause or mechanism.

# Exercise: Failing Water System in Lamont

## Background

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
As of 2024, California had 220 failing drinking water systems serving
nearly half a million people.

One of them, Lamont, received \$25 million in Water Board funding to
help fix their water system, which included three wells exceeding the Maximum
Contaminant Level of arsenic and 1,2,3-tricholoropropane.

## Interrogating the failing water system in Lamont

-   Why is the water contaminated?
-   Who was exposed to water from this system? How?
-   Are there racial disparities in exposure? Why?

## Who was exposed?

- 2020 Decennial Census data
  - Why Decennial Census, not ACS? Block level vs. tract level
  - Maybe should start with ACS...
- Why R/APIs?
  - Public data resources are being removed, e.g., the EPA's Environmental Justice Screen
  - Lower level resources, like APIs, are less visible and therefore lower priority for censoring

-   What are some of the assumptions that weâ€™ve made in this analysis,
    either explicitly or implicitly that could pose a problem?
    -   Water use is evenly distributed
    -   Census data accurately reflects the population
        -   Migrant workers, Tribal populations underrepresented
    -   Everyone is equally capable of choosing/changing where they live
    -   The demographic groups we selected are representative of the
        entire population

## Exercise: Failing Water Systems in Lamont, Calif.

In 2024, the US EPA attempted to predict the probability that residents
within a census block were using water from a public utility or private
well. Their model used data from the 1990 Decennial Census,
administrative data on well permitting, and other measures.

```{r water_source_data, cache=TRUE}
well_data_file <- "./data/well_blocks.csv"
if (!file.exists(well_data_file)) {
  res <- download.file("https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/USEPA/ORD_Water_Source_2020/5e717b36419251bec97d8795a2e08308f9a7faef/outputs/Well_Estimates_2020_Blks.csv?download=true",
                       destfile=well_data_file,
                       method="curl")
}

water_sources <- read_tsv(well_data_file)
```

```{r census_with_water_sources, cache=TRUE}
city_blocks_with_water_sources <- merge(city_blocks,
                                        water_sources,
                                        by.x = "GEOID",
                                        by.y = "GEOID_Blk",
                                        all.x = TRUE)
```

```{r census_blocks_with_water_sources_map, cache=TRUE, fig.cap="Probability of Public Water"}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(city_blocks_with_water_sources,
          mapping = aes(geometry = geometry,
                        fill = Prob_Pub),
                        color = NA) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "OrRd", direction = 1, labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(fill = "Probability of Public Water") +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

## Summary statistics

```{r weighted_averages}
demo_summary <- city_blocks_with_water_sources %>%
  summarize(
    prop_white = weighted.mean(Prob_Pub, w = value_White, na.rm = TRUE),
    prop_black = weighted.mean(Prob_Pub, w = value_Black, na.rm = TRUE),
    prop_hispanic = weighted.mean(Prob_Pub, w = value_Hispanic, na.rm = TRUE),
    pp_white = sum(Prob_Pub * value_White, na.rm = TRUE),
    pp_black = sum(Prob_Pub * value_Black, na.rm = TRUE),
    pp_hispanic = sum(value_Hispanic, na.rm = TRUE),
    white = sum(value_White, na.rm = TRUE),
    black = sum(value_Black, na.rm = TRUE),
    hispanic = sum(value_Hispanic, na.rm = TRUE)

  )
```

Weighted averages for the probability a group of people in Franklin
county are connected to a public water system by block are as follows:

## Sharpening analysis

-   Talk to people in Lamont?
-   Read about arsenic and 1,2,3-trichloropropane and their common
    sources as pollutants.
-   What else?
    -   Redlining resource
